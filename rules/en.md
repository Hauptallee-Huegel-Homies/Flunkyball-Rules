## Reaction Phase

2. The _Offence_ may start to drink if they successfully and legally used the
   _throwing object_ to tip over the _target_.
3. Once the _target_ is repositioned within the _circle_, and all players of the
   _Defence_ return behind their _beerline_ they may signal the _Offence_ to
   stop.
4. After all players are behind their _beerlines_ and the _throwing object_ is
   under the control of the _Defence_, the _Reaction Phase_ ends and the teams
   swap roles.

## Tiebreaker

1. If both teams do not hit the target for two _laps_, both teams are allowed to
   move their _beerline_ two times the length of the shortest shoe of all
   players remaining in the game, towards the _centre_.

# Penalties

1. It is the obligation of the other team to demand penalties on rule violations.
2. Penalties can only occur self-inflicted or due to legal actions of the other
   team.
3. At the offending player's discretion they are allowed to choose a higher
   penalty.
